Secrets, such as database passwords and private keys are 
a key part of security systems.  Unfortunately, secrets are hard to securely 
distribute, rotate, and revoke, especially without changing existing software.

To address these issues, a technique called \sysname has been developed.
\sysname automatically provisions containers with secrets without
requiring the use of environment variables.  It also ensures that applications
obtains a secret in a natural way, reading a file from disk, instead of 
requiring application modification to call a custom API or to possess 
specialized hardware (e.g., SGX).  Additionally, 
Docker secrets are securely distributed and are never stored or transmitted 
in an unencrypted form.  Information stored in Docker secrets can be changed 
and revoked automatically, which enables better dev ops security practices, 
such as hourly TLS key rotation.  The deployment of Docker secrets has been
in production since Docker 1.13, and is running in ?millions? of containers.
